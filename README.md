# Personal_Popular_Tags
# This is a project I am working on that takes the videos from your Youtube landing page and creates a dictionary of the tags from it, and counts how many of each tag there are. It will return a printed statement for your tag with the highest count (the most popular on) as well as create an excel document to list them all.
